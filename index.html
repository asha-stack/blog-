        <p class="mt-4">As protests continue to erupt in Minneapolis and around the country following the <br/> murder of George Floyd at the hands of the police — only the most recent and <br/> publicized of many such murders — people have understandably been turning
            to <br/> their online social networks to learn more about how to engage in anti-racism work.<br/> For white and non-Black people, comprehensive education on how to be an effective<br/> ally, and on the history of racism, is sorely lacking
            in our schools and families, but is <br/> widely available if you know where to look.</p>
